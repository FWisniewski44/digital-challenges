abstract: "This paper will revolve around the topic of technocracy. Whilst it has been examined in detail on state level, research about citizens' attitudes towards this concept of government is still rather scarce. Building remotely upon the hypotheses and findings of Bertsou & Pastorella (2017), this paper has a twofold goal: first, it will function at least partially as a replication study to aforementioned research, testing parts of the results for validity with newer data available. Secondly, new inferences could be drawn (if found)."

# Introduction
One of the most discussed themes in political science over the last years most definitely was _populism_. Especially in the US – with the rise of Donald Trump to become the 45th president  in 2017 and the accompanying transformation of the Republican Party – this phenomenon evolved into a well-researched topic. But not only there: also in Europe, the rise of populism and populist politicians became a big issue, also within the scientific community - namely triggered by e. g. left-wing populist SYRIZA's rise to power in Greece, the emergence of the AfD as a right-wing populist party in Germany, or the presidential race in France being decided between the liberal candidate Macron and the right-wing or even far right populist Marine Le Pen.
When talking and writing about it, one comes across many different definitions to the same term populism: Cas Mudde’s 'populism as a thin ideology' [@mudde2004populist], Ernesto Laclau’s 'populism as a discursive strategy' [@laclau2005populist], Jan-Werner Müller’s 'methods of populism' [@müller2016populismus] or the 'ideational approach' by Kirk Hawkins and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser [@hawkins2018ideational].

But populism is by far not the only 'alternative approach' to representative democracy. One of the other possible views is technocracy, and research within this space is still very fluid and evolving in this field within political science. A lot of said research has so far often concentrated on the more normative aspects of technocracy [@habermas2015lure] or has taken a rather expert-centered stance, discussing the determination of who the experts would be and who chooses when someone is considered one [@bickerton2020technocracy]. But there is more to _'technocracy' as a whole topic_ than that. For example, one could also ask the question of how the citizens themselves see this concept in turn.

This paper seeks to take this more citizen-centered approach: the question that will be addressed is about their attitudes towards this alternative concept of government and governance. Other social scientists have very recently taken up this narrative before and have shown that there is significant homogeneity throughout Europe's people when talking about their opinions of technocracy (see e. g. @bertsou2017technocratic, @ganuza2020experts, @lavezzolo2021will, @chiru2022wants or @bertsou2022people). However, the data they used was from back in 2009; this makes it highly likely that citizens' attitudes towards technocracy may have evolved and changed over time, especially considering events after 2009 up to the origin of the newer data set in 2017, like the Brexit referendum or the aftermath of the financial crisis in Europe.

Therefore, taking survey data about citizens' stances towards technocracy in European countries, the  this exploratory analysis aims at shedding more light upon the real-world implications of technocracy as a normative concept with updated data and see if previously obtained results nowadays still hold. Also, as a secondary goal, it shall be examined if there are certain patterns within the cross-national data that promise even more interesting research perspectives for the future.

# Theoretical considerations
## Conceptual background: defining the concept of technocracy and 

<!-- + Caramani 2020 -->
<!-- + Dahl's 'On Democracy' -->
<!-- + Bertsou's works -->
<!-- + Plato's Republic -->
<!-- + McDonnell & Valbruzzi 2014 -->
<!-- + differentiation from stealth democracy -->

As mentioned in the introductory paragraph, technocracy could be considered a still evolving field of action within the social sciences. But that does not mean that there is nothing to draw from in theory. Technocracy as a concept is first mentioned or described by Plato (stemming from the Greek _'techne'_, translated as 'art' or 'craft'). As explained by Bickerton and Accetti, this is what can be considered the classical argument for technocracy: Plato believed that to really fulfill the goal of _good_ government, i. e. to justly rule and bring order to the social lives of the people within society, the one who governs needs to have suitable skills to do so. Those, they further interpret Plato, can be found in the philosophers: they would know about and have the skills required to do so [see @bickerton2020technocracy, pp. 32f.].

Another aspect that describes the difference between democratic/representative and technocratic systems has been given by Robert A. Dahl in his classic 'On Democracy' in the chapter 'Ideal Democracy'. He takes a position of staunch resistance toward technocratic expert government, stating: _'Because experts may be qualified to serve as your agents does not mean that they are qualified to serve as your rulers.'_ [@dahl_onDemocracy, p. 73]
Thereby, he made the exact opposite point to Plato's argument described before. The latter assumed the philosopher-kings (so to say, the 'proto-technocrats') to be the best possible rulers because they have a certain set of skills that the broad masses do not have and would apply it to achieve the greater good for all of society --- democracy as a form of governance, in turn, could cause chaos.
Dahl on the other hand brings forth the notion of _corruption through power_, by which the pursuit of the 'greater good' for the whole society can be undermined. *Sobald Buch vorhanden, hier weiterschreiben*

To further shed light on the term 'technocracy', another definition given by @caramani2020technocratic should be considered. He considers it to be 'a form of power in which decisions over the allocation of values are made by experts or technical elites based on their knowledge, independently and in the long-term interest of the whole of society' [@caramani2020technocratic, p. 3].
He further adds four features making government technocratic in nature [@caramani2020technocratic, pp. 3f.]:

1. The source of power is knowledge, rather than popular will (e. g. through elections).

2. Political representation is realized via a „trustee model“, where citizens lack the knowledge and wisdom to enter the political arena themselves. Their „trustees“ (i. e. the experts) do that for them, turning democracy and elections into a mere elite selection process.

3. Politics is seen by the expert elites as a means to enhance the „greater good“ and acting in the common interest.

4. The common interest itself is assessed through science, rationally, and as objective as possible, not by ideology or derived from pluralist preference aggregation within the people.

For this paper, it is also important to discuss how technocracy may be measured. When doing attitudinal research with citizens, especially concerning elusive and heterogenous topics like technocracy, researchers have to be careful --- as not every respondent understands the same under such complex concepts. To 

## The road so far: what has been found out about technocracy on state- and individual level?

<!-- + maybe include technopopulism? -->
<!-- + Deseriis -->
<!-- + Bickerton/Accetti, the book -->

Now, after having defined in detail the implications of technocratic systems, the area of tension between representative democracy and technocracy, and the problem this paper wants to address, it is also necessary to take a look at what research so far has found out.

To start off, @mcdonnell2014defining point out an important point, also relevant in the context of this paper: there is a recognizably different thrust throughout Europe when talking about the degree to which technocracy may be witnessed within national governments. They set three basic rules as to when a government is to be regarded as an ideal type technocratic one [see @mcdonnell2014defining, p. 656]:

  1. Elected officials of parties do not make all governmental decisions.
  2. Policies do not have their roots within parties which after deciding them, act to implement them.
  3. High officials such as (prime) ministers do not have a party background.
  
By applying these rules, they classify governments in Europe between 1945 and 2013. They also discern between full technocratic governments and technocrat-led party governments. Examining their results, they see two implications: technocratic governments form more easily in countries where there is a stronger head of state, and this government type is more frequently observed in countries with weaker party systems or those, that only recently developed a democratic political system [see @mcdonnell2014defining, p. 666].

@font2015participation apply these findings in their study about 

## (Hypotheses?)

<!-- + hypotheses in Bertsou/Pastorella 2017 -->
<!-- + other Bertsou papers? -->
<!-- + Caramani? -->
<!-- + the Caramani/Bertsou book on technocracy 2020? -->

### individual level hypotheses
+ H1: If a person sees democracy in a positive light, in turn, he/she will see technocracy in a negative light.
+ H2: Technocracy is seen more negatively when trust in political institutions of representative democracy is higher.
+ H3: Higher trust in the (more technocratic) EU will lead to a more positive view of technocracy with citizens.

### country level hypotheses
+ H4: Positive attitudes towards technocracy will occur more frequently in countries with more (perceived) corruption.
+ H5: Positive attitudes towards technocracy will occur more frequently in countries that are in a bad shape economically (via GDP p. c.).
+ H6: Countries that have experienced communist-authoritarian leadership in the past will show more positive attitudes towards technocracy. (especially in South/Central Eastern Europe)
+ H7: Countries that have already had experience with technocratic governments in the past will show more positive attitudes towards technocracy (via list in McDonnell/Valbruzzi 2014)

### other hypotheses
+ H8 (individual, Chiru & Enyedi): People that are better educated will have more positive attitudes towards expert government (i. e. technocracy). ---> this is contrary to the stealth democracy-beliefs that the uneducated favour stealth democracy over representative status quo; they do not have clear findings for their 9 countries, so maybe test it for full EU

### hypotheses with regard to science/technology vs. faith/religion
+ H9: People that, generally speaking, have a high opinion of science, technology, and knowledge tend to also view technocracy and government by experts in a more positive light. (I would build indices from WVS vars)
  + reasoning: those people tend to view knowledge and expertise higher, therefore I would state that they would value expertise over 'mere' representative party politicians when talking about implementing what they consider important in areas like digitization, health care, military technology, etc.
+ H10: People that have stronger religious beliefs/are more religious/have more (religious) faith tend to view technocracy and government by experts/expertise in a more negative light.
  + reasoning: people that have stronger religious beliefs generally tend to view science (and therefore also scientific reasoning) more critically, putting an emphasis on God's intervention, therefore being more critical of 'governance by reason' alone


# Methods and data

<!-- + describe the EVS -->
<!-- + describe the independent variable -->
<!-- + describe the explanatory variables with regard to how they exactly operationalize the points mentioned under paragraph 2 -->
