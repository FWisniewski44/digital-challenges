# Introduction
One of the most discussed themes in political science over the last years most definitely was populism. Especially in the US – with the rise of Donald Trump to become the 45th president  in 2017 and the accompanying transformation of the Republican Party – this phenomenon evolved into a well-researched topic. When talking and writing about it, one comes across many different definitions to the same term populism: Cas Mudde’s „populism as a thin ideology“ (Mudde 2004), Ernesto Laclau’s „populism as a discursive strategy“ (Laclau 2005), Jan-Werner Müller’s „methods of populism“ (Müller 2016) or the „ideational approach“ by Kirk Hawkins and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser (Hawkins & Rovira Kaltwasser 2019).

But populism is by far not the only „alternative approach“ to a representatively democratic political system. One of the other possible views is technocracy, and research within this space is still very fluid and evolving in this field within political science.
