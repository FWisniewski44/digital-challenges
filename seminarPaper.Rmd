abstract: "This paper will revolve around the topic of technocracy. Whilst it has been examined in detail on state level, research about citizens' attitudes towards this concept of government is still rather scarce. Building remotely upon the hypotheses and findings of Bertsou & Pastorella (2017), this paper has a twofold goal: first, it will function at least partially as a replication study to aforementioned research, testing parts of the results for validity with newer data available. Secondly, new inferences could be drawn (if found)."

# Introduction
One of the most discussed themes in political science over the last years most definitely was _populism_. Especially in the US – with the rise of Donald Trump to become the 45th president  in 2017 and the accompanying transformation of the Republican Party – this phenomenon evolved into a well-researched topic. But not only there: also in Europe, the rise of populism and populist politicians became a big issue, also within the scientific community - namely triggered by e. g. left-wing populist SYRIZA's rise to power in Greece, the emergence of the AfD as a right-wing populist party in Germany, or the presidential race in France being decided between the liberal candidate Macron and the right-wing or even far right populist Marine Le Pen.
When talking and writing about it, one comes across many different definitions to the same term populism: Cas Mudde’s 'populism as a thin ideology' [@mudde2004populist], Ernesto Laclau’s 'populism as a discursive strategy' [@laclau2005populist], Jan-Werner Müller’s 'methods of populism' [@müller2016populismus] or the 'ideational approach' by Kirk Hawkins and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser [@hawkins2018ideational].

But populism is by far not the only 'alternative approach' to representative democracy. One of the other possible views is technocracy, and research within this space is still very fluid and evolving in this field within political science. A lot of said research has so far often concentrated on the more normative aspects of technocracy [@habermas2015lure] or has taken a rather expert-centered stance, discussing the determination of who the experts would be and who chooses when someone is considered one [@bickerton2020technocracy]. But there is more to _'technocracy' as a whole topic_ than that. For example, one could also ask the question of how the citizens themselves see this concept in turn.

This paper seeks to take this more citizen-centered approach: the question that will be addressed is about their attitudes towards this alternative concept of government and governance. Other social scientists have very recently taken up this narrative before and have shown that there is significant homogeneity throughout Europe's people when talking about their opinions of technocracy (see e. g. @bertsou2017technocratic, @ganuza2020experts, @lavezzolo2021will, @chiru2022wants or @bertsou2022people). However, the data they used was from back in 2009; this makes it highly likely that citizens' attitudes towards technocracy may have evolved and changed over time, especially considering events after 2009 up to the origin of the newer data set in 2017, like the Brexit referendum or the aftermath of the financial crisis in Europe.

Therefore, taking survey data about citizens' stances towards technocracy in European countries,   this exploratory analysis aims at shedding more light upon the real-world implications of technocracy as a normative concept with updated data and see if previously obtained results nowadays still hold. Also, as a secondary goal, it shall be examined if there are certain patterns within the cross-national data that promise even more interesting research perspectives for the future.

# Theoretical considerations
## Conceptual background: defining the concept of technocracy and 

<!-- + Caramani 2020 -->
<!-- + Dahl's 'On Democracy' -->
<!-- + Bertsou's works -->
<!-- + Plato's Republic -->
<!-- + McDonnell & Valbruzzi 2014 -->
<!-- + differentiation from stealth democracy -->

As mentioned in the introductory paragraph, technocracy could be considered a still evolving field of action within the social sciences. But that does not mean that there is nothing to draw from in theory. Technocracy as a concept is first mentioned or described by Plato (stemming from the Greek _'techne'_, translated as 'art' or 'craft'). As explained by Bickerton and Accetti, this is what can be considered the classical argument for technocracy: Plato believed that to really fulfill the goal of _good_ government, i. e. to justly rule and bring order to the social lives of the people within society, the one who governs needs to have suitable skills to do so. Those, they further interpret Plato, can be found in the philosophers: they would know about and have the skills required to do so [see @bickerton2020technocracy, pp. 32f.].

Another aspect that describes the difference between democratic/representative and technocratic systems has been given by Robert A. Dahl in his classic 'On Democracy' in the chapter 'Ideal Democracy'. He takes a position of staunch resistance toward technocratic expert government, stating: _'Because experts may be qualified to serve as your agents does not mean that they are qualified to serve as your rulers.'_ [@dahl_onDemocracy, p. 73]
Thereby, he made the exact opposite point to Plato's argument described before. The latter assumed the philosopher-kings (so to say, the 'proto-technocrats') to be the best possible rulers because they have a certain set of skills that the broad masses do not have and would apply it to achieve the greater good for all of society --- democracy as a form of governance, in turn, could cause chaos.
Dahl on the other hand brings forth the notion of _corruption through power_, by which the pursuit of the 'greater good' for the whole society can be undermined. 

To further shed light on the term 'technocracy' itself, another definition given by @caramani2020technocratic should be considered. He considers it to be 'a form of power in which decisions over the allocation of values are made by experts or technical elites based on their knowledge, independently and in the long-term interest of the whole of society' [@caramani2020technocratic, p. 3].
He further adds four features making government technocratic in nature [@caramani2020technocratic, pp. 3f.]:

1. The source of power is knowledge, rather than popular will (e. g. through elections).

2. Political representation is realized via a „trustee model“, where citizens lack the knowledge and wisdom to enter the political arena themselves. Their „trustees“ (i. e. the experts) do that for them, turning democracy and elections into a mere elite selection process.

3. Politics is seen by the expert elites as a means to enhance the „greater good“ and acting in the common interest.

4. The common interest itself is assessed through science, rationally, and as objective as possible, not by ideology or derived from pluralist preference aggregation within the people.

For this paper, it is also important to discuss how technocracy may be measured. When doing attitudinal research with citizens, especially concerning elusive and heterogeneous topics like technocracy, researchers have to be careful --- as not every respondent understands the same under such complex concepts. This is why one should also take a look at what empirical studies of the concept, both with focus on a state- and a citizen-level have already found so far.

## What was found out so far: empirical and theoretical studies on technocracy and technocratic attitudes


<!-- + maybe include technopopulism? -->
<!-- + Deseriis -->
<!-- + Bickerton/Accetti, the book -->

Now, after having defined in detail the implications of technocratic systems, the area of tension between representative democracy and technocracy, and the problem this paper wants to address, it is also necessary, as mentioned before, to take a look at what empirical studies have found out so far.

To start off, @mcdonnell2014defining point out an important discovery, also to an extent relevant in the context of this paper: there is a recognizably different thrust throughout Europe when talking about the degree to which technocracy may be witnessed within national governments. They set three basic rules as to when a government is to be regarded as an ideal type technocratic one [see @mcdonnell2014defining, p. 656]:

  1. Elected officials of parties do not make all governmental decisions.
  2. Policies do not have their roots within parties which after deciding them, act to implement them.
  3. High officials such as (prime) ministers do not have a party background.
  
By applying these rules, they classify governments in Europe between 1945 and 2013. They also discern between full technocratic governments and technocrat-led party governments. Examining their results, they see two implications: technocratic governments form more easily in countries where there is a stronger head of state, and this government type is more frequently observed in countries with weaker party systems or those, that only recently developed a democratic political system [see @mcdonnell2014defining, p. 666].

@font2015participation apply these findings in their study about Spaniards attitudes towards political participation and political decision-making. While with @mcdonnell2014defining, the results were centered at the state-level, they go a different route, concentrating more on the 'demand side' for technocracy and expert government.
They find, that expert-based decision-making is indeed viewed as a third alternative by citizens in Spain (with the other two being democratic ones: representative and participative decision-making). Explaining this distinction and also the citizens' tendency to really actually notice expert-based government, they point to several factors, e. g. lacking trust in either elected representatives or their citizen peers as far as political decisions are concerned, a desire to incorporate efficiency and expertise into the decision process, and/or wanting technocratic actors to play a more central role in said process. Concluding their study, they state that for some citizens, the contrast to their currently in-place political system is very important (like e. g. in Spain, representative democracy), so that those with more favourable views for expert government could be supposed to be more dissatisfied with it --- and therefore rendering _any_ alternative more appealing [@font2015participation, pp. 165f.].

Another central finding in the technocracy and expert government research sphere was put forth by @lavezzolo2021will. They mention an important distinction when talking about what technocracy is and in which forms it may occur. Their explanations and results are also important for this paper, because it sheds more light on what people may actually think and most importantly _understand_ when asked about 'technocracy'.

## Hypotheses to be tested in this paper

<!-- + hypotheses in Bertsou/Pastorella 2017 -->
<!-- + other Bertsou papers? -->
<!-- + Caramani? -->
<!-- + the Caramani/Bertsou book on technocracy 2020? -->

Having explored both the theoretical background of technocracy as a concept (including definitions of the term) under 2.1, and also some crucial findings under 2.2, in paragraph 2.3, the hypotheses that shall be tested in this paper will be stated. Those will consist of the tried-and-tested ones in this research space, taken also from the aforementioned studies under 2.2 --- but tested with newer data. Also, to supplement scholarly work therein, two new hypotheses will be generated and theoretically justified in the course of this paragraph. All in all, a two step approach will be taken: both individual level and country level hypotheses will be formulated.

### Core hypotheses on the individual level
The first of the core hypotheses having been constantly checked and updated by scholars with newer data becoming available over the years has been citizens' attitudes towards democracy as a form of governance (see e. g. @bengtsson2009direct, @coffe2014education and @bertsou2017technocratic). Those studies come from different directions, with some measuring citizens' support for stealth democracy, others for technocracy and expert government. Also, they yielded different results, as @chiru2022wants point out. This is why the hypothesis shall be tested again in the context of this paper. The reasoning behind this is follows @bertsou2017technocratic: citizens that generally trust democratic institutions and players and are satisified with them and the system as a whole will not be fond of technocracy as a sort-of 'contender' to it. Therefore, the first hypothesis will be:

>H1: The more satisfied people are with democracy as a political system, the less likely it becomes for them to support technocracy/expert government.

The next hypothesis is grounded in the contrast of technocracy and democracy regarding institutions. As put forth by @bertsou2017technocratic, if citizens have had experiences that would diminish their trust in democracy's representative institutions (like e. g. a series of unreliable governments that made ineffective decisions when implementing policies), this could lead to them being more receptive for the ideas of experts governing --- believing in the notion that they could do it in a better way. On the contrary, citizens that have more trust in their political system of representative democracy would be less likely to have a positive opinion on technocracy [see @bertsou2017technocratic, p. 434f.].
Another important criticism of democratic decision-making by technocratically minded citizens is highlighted by @bertsou2022people, where it is stated that the lower trust of those people comes from their perceived ineffectivity and irresponsibility with democratic decision-making and -makers. This paper therefore tests the following as a second hypothesis:

> H2: Technocracy and expert government are seen more negatively when trust in political institutions of representative democracy is higher.

In a similar vein, @bertsou2017technocratic have found evidence that people with higher political interest would see technocratic government in a more negative view. They derived this from the stealth democracy literature (e. g. @hibbing2002stealth and coffe2014education) [@bertsou2017technocratic, p. 435], listing the variable in their pool of controls for their analysis. Therefore, this paper's models will also contain a fitting variable, checking for the effect with the following hypothesis:

> H3: Technocracy and expert government are seen more negatively when citizens' political interest is higher.

As already pointed out by @bengtsson2009direct as part of the research on stealth democracy, it has been found out that more right-wing oriented people favour more expert decision-making over democratic forms of government [@bengtsson2009direct, p. 1045].
On the other end of this spatial political spectrum, @donovan2006popular found out that with left-wing oriented citizens, it is quite the contrary: in some countries, those people were more likely than political 'moderates' to favour the use of popular referendums, thus they would prefer more direct citizen intervention in politics than right-wing oriented people [@donovan2006popular, p. 681, p. 684].
Previously, this reasoning has been empirically proven by e. g. @bertsou2017technocratic or @bertsou2022people and also partially by @chiru2022wants.
From that background, to see if this will also hold in the context of this paper and to further empirically contest the reasoning behind it, the fourth hypothesis reads as follows:

> H4: The further on the ideological/political right citizens perceive themselves to be, the more likely it is for them to support technocracy/expert government.

For the fourth hypothesis, this paper turns again to the findings of @chiru2022wants. In their study, they have taken the state-level hypothesis of @bertsou2017technocratic, but have applied it on the citizen-level. They justified this by stating that there were other factors that, for corruption perception, had interaction effects on the country-level, therefore making a citizen-level necessary. As also shown by @chiru2012voter and @ecker2016corruption, incumbent governments, parties, and politicians may well be held accountable for their corruption, if perceived by citizens --- yet again, on the other hand, it has also been discussed that there is a possibility for them to remain in power regardless, if there is no really viable alternative for voters (see @charron2016ideology or @hooghe2011distrusting). If punished or not, nevertheless, corruption and citizens perceiving it can contribute to them losing faith in their current political system (@ziller2015pure), which is why this paper hypothesizes:

> H5: Technocracy is seen more positively by citizens that perceive corruption to be a major problem in the political system of their country.

The fourth hypothesis will revolve around citizens' educational level. Starting off from the stealth democracy literature once again, we first visit @coffe2014education with an important contribution in this area. Regarding citizens educational background, they provided two alternative hypotheses: one relying on _cognitive mobilization theory_ (better education meaning more favourable views of direct citizen involvement in politics through direct democracy) and the other on _political dissatisfaction theory_ (better education meaning less favourable views of direct citizen involvement through direct democracy) [@coffe2014education, pp. 3-4], finding evidence in favour of the _political dissatisfaction theory_-hypothesis [@coffe2014education, p. 6].
On the other hand, @chiru2022wants point out that the findings in this area have also been contested and a bit contradictory when taking a look at their more recent study. They refer to e. g. @bengtsson2009direct that found that people with higher education tended to have lower support for both direct and stealth democracy than those with lower education. They themselves found a contrary effect: people with higher education show favourable attitudes towards technocracy more often [@chiru2022wants, p. 109]. This is also somewhat supported by @bertsou2022people, as they state: 'technocratic-minded citizens are expected to be highly educated, given the emphasis placed on the superior skills of a knowledge elite and the scientific approach to politics' [@bertsou2022people, p. 9]. Therefore, to further shed light on the relation of educational level with technocratic attitudes and to also test the claims made by @chiru2022wants about people with more social capital and higher income levels favouring technocratic expert government, the sixth hypothesis reads as:

> H6: Citizens that are better educated, have more social capital, and have more income view technocracy in a more positive way.

<!-- + coffe/michels & bertsou: dumb people think stealth democracy is good, as lower educated people see representative democracy as too big of a challenge and perceive themselves to have low political efficacy -->
<!-- + chiru/enyedi: findings have gone off in multiple directions, causing doubt, this is why it's checked again -->
<!-- + bertsou2022people: technocratic minded people are expected to be of higher education, skilled, a knowledge elite -->
<!-- + contested, therefore again test of the chiru/enyedi hypothesis -->
<!-- + Chiru & Enyedi: People that are better educated will have more positive attitudes towards expert government (i. e. technocracy). this is contrary to the stealth democracy-beliefs that the uneducated favour stealth democracy over representative status quo; they do not have clear findings for their 9 countries, so maybe test it for full EU -->


<!-- other hypotheses from bertsou pastorella 17 -->

<!-- + H5: Positive attitudes towards technocracy will occur more frequently in countries that are in a bad shape economically (via GDP p. c.). -->

<!-- + H6: Countries that have experienced communist-authoritarian leadership in the past will show more positive attitudes towards technocracy. (especially in South/Central Eastern Europe) -->

<!-- + H7: Countries that have already had experience with technocratic governments in the past will show more positive attitudes towards technocracy (via list in McDonnell/Valbruzzi 2014) -->

### New hypothesis with regard to citizens' views on science/technology

While the first five hypotheses were ones that were already included in former studies, this paper aims to also contribute a new facet to attitudinal research concerning technocracy. As was already mentioned, the findings, especially when talking about the relationship of education and attitudes towards expert government, are not fully clear; arguments have been made in favour of what has been found both in technocracy and in stealth democracy research.
Building on suggestions put forth by @bertsou2020measuring for the measurement of technocracy, it is being deduced that when breaking down the concept into its parts, one of them is the so-called _'scientific approach'_. This encompasses that there is some sort of ground truth and fitting solution to every problem that may arise. As the authors themselves phrase it: 

> "[...] Technocratic politics follows a positivist paradigm. There is a belief in the existence of an optimal solution or truth, which can be discovered through careful and objective analysis of scientific evidence. [...] This scientific approach complements the aforementioned elitist, anti-political and anti-pluralist dimensions by emphasizing the role of expert knowledge, political neutrality and problem-solving capacities." [@bertsou2020measuring, p.5]

In said article, they also begin constructing a basic codebook for technocratic discourse research. Within this, one dimension deals with the aforementioned scientific approach, stating that discourse can be viewed as positive about technocracy, if it includes e. g. reference to objective, neutral, non-compromised decision making, evidence-based policymaking or critical voices that question facts or the scientific method. On the contrary, it is viewed as negative about technocracy, when it contains e. g. doubt of factual evidence, reference to subjective or compromised decision- and policymakers ordoubt of the complexity of social problems [see @bertsou2020measuring, p. 11].

Taking into account these theoretical considerations and (preliminary) findings about the nature of technocracy and technocratic discourse, some 'lessons learned' can be drawn from the authors about citizens' technocratic attitudes, too.
The _'scientific approach'_ could also be converted to the plane of attitudinal research, stating e. g. that more science-friendly people would also have more technocratic views. This could be explained by the scientific 'mode of thinking': taking e. g. a positivist paradigm and searching for an optimal solution, being objective and analytical, reliant on knowledge, and oriented towards problem solving --- those traits are also imaginable to be found _within_ citizens or to be considered good characteristics _by_ citizens.
Such people, when confronted with the choice of some form of democracy (be it representative or even direct) and technocracy are expected by this paper to tend to the latter. When e. g. also considering the implementation process of policies, people that have a more positive attitude towards science and technology are thought to rather have experts govern and take care of such policies than 'mere' representative party politicians without expert knowledge or party expertise. Therefore, H7 takes up these thoughts, stating:

> H7: People that have a higher opinion of science and technology tend to view technocracy and government by experts in a more positive light.


<!-- + H6: People that, generally speaking, have a higher opinion of science and technology tend to also view technocracy and government by experts in a more positive light. -->
<!--   + reasoning: those people tend to view knowledge and expertise higher, therefore I would state that -->
<!-- they would value expertise over 'mere' representative party politicians when talking about implementing what they consider important in areas like digitization, health care, military technology, etc. -->

<!-- + H7: People that have stronger religious beliefs/are more religious/have more (religious) faith tend to view technocracy and government by experts/expertise in a more negative light. -->
<!--   + reasoning: people that have stronger religious beliefs generally tend to view science (and therefore also scientific reasoning) more critically, putting an emphasis on God's intervention, therefore being more critical of 'governance by reason' alone -->


# Methods and data

<!-- + describe the EVS, WVS -->
<!-- + describe the independent variable -->
<!-- + describe the explanatory variables with regard to how they exactly operationalize the points mentioned under paragraph 2 -->
<!-- + describe the method of choice (logistic regression? do we need to control for country effects? hierarchical models?) -->

## Data and caveats
The data set utilized in this paper is the _World Values Survey_ (wave 7; also called WVS), which features data collected from 2017 until the end of 2021. As of the writing of this paper, the organization is still unsure about the end of this wave, making it possible that there are changes and additions to be made to the data used here.
As stated on the project's website, the WVS is an research programme, studying people's opinions and attitudes as well as values, highlighting social, political, economic, religious, and cultural differences and similarities. It was started by Prof. Ronald Inglehart back in 1981 and is, according to their own information, the world's largest non-commercial academic social survey programme [@wvs2022info].
This paper chooses to work with said data set, as the variable and country availability is generally very good. Another alternative would have been the European Values Study (EVS), containing fewer samples only from European states, and also less variables. The WVS was the preferred option here, as it contained also information about citizens' attitudes towards science and technology, which play an important role in this article.

## Case selection of the paper
The countries selected for this paper include Germany, Greece, Romania, Brazil, and Argentina. Reasons for choosing them within the WVS are twofold: (1) because of data availability and thereby (2) being able to follow the argumentation of @chiru2022wants. They also chose those countries (among others), pointing to different experiences with democratic systems, but also different regime types with different degrees of corruption, and different backgrounds with technocracy, technocratic decision-making, and expert government --- therefore providing for a high degree of variation between the cases, and by that, a good means of testing hypotheses. Due to data availability, compared to @chiru2022wants, the Netherlands, the UK, Switzerland and Hungary had to be dropped, leaving the countries mentioned above to be researched.

The case selection shall also be explained in a bit more detail per country, also using typologies and data from @mcdonnell2014defining.
Greece and Romania are both countries that have had significant experience with technocrat-led or even full technocratic governments. While in Greece this happened more often more recently (with the Papademos and the Pikrammenos governments in 2011-2012 and mid-2012 respectively), most of Romania's experience comes from the 1990s (especially with the Vacaroiu governments between 1992-1996), but it also encountered one more recently with the Ciolos cabinet in 2015-2016 (see @mcdonnell2014defining, p. 663, p. 665 and @chiru2022wants, p. 103).
The German case represents a country that has not yet experienced such a high degree of technocracy in its governments, but one could argue that during the COVID-19 pandemic, a shift to more technocratic or expert-driven decision-making could be noticed --- as was in many democracies around the world (see @windholz2020governing, @bylund2021separation, or @kuhlmann2021tracing). Also, the media sometimes pointed out this tendency (see e. g. @FAZ2020virologen).
Moving on to the two South American cases, Argentina and Brazil; both of them have experienced a fair share of non-political or 'expert' minister appointments in the past, with Brazil even more so than Argentina [see @chiru2022wants, pp. 102f.]. Furthermore, they provide an additional focus point outside of Europe, making them valuable additions to the country subset used in this paper.

## Variables included and operationalization of concepts with the WVS
Before describing the method used to test the hypotheses of this paper, it is important to first take a look at the variables and indices used for testing individually. The dependent variable regarding _citizens' attitudes towards technocracy_ has been recoded for this academic endeavour to be of binary shape, with 0 indicating a generally negative view of technocracy and 1 indicating a positive view of the concept. Occasionally, especially when visualizing the variable in the univariate part of the paper, its original 4-level structure will be used, indicating the 'mid-steps' of (dis-)agreement with technocracy.

_Self-ascribed position on left-right-scale_ is a variable that measures the position of citizens on a scale of 1 (left) to 10 (right). The variable was treated as quasi-metric, focusing more on a continuous depiction of political ideology, rather than seeing each and every level individually as a 'statement' of a citizen. It will be used to check H4.
_Perception of corruption in respondents' respective country_ is used to check H5. It measures on a scale of 1 (no corruption is perceived in the country) to 10 (abundant corruption is perceived in the country).
_Political interest_ measures the degree to which a citizen is interested in politics and is being used to test H3. It was recoded into a binary variable, with 0 meaning "not politically interested" and 1 meaning "politically interested". This was done to ease interpretation.
_Political trust_ is an index that was created from three variables: confidence in national parliament, national government, and national parties per citizen, just as suggested in @bertsou2017technocratic. It is used to check for H2 and ranges from 1 (low trust) to 10 (high trust). Cronbach's alpha is at 0.87, indicating an excellent fit of the index.
_Satisfaction with democracy_ is a variable that has been measured quite differently throughout technocracy research (see e. g. @bertsou2017technocratic vs. @chiru2022wants). In this paper, it is measured by a single item that reads as follows: "How satisfied are you with how the political system is functioning in your country these days? On the scale from 1 to 10 below, 1 means not satisfied at all and 10 means completely satisfied". This is also the reason why results with this variable may not be fully comparable with other studies but the variable will be used here to check H1. 
_Respondents' age, education, income_ are variables that indicate demographic/economic information about individual citizens. They are self-explanatory. Educational level and income are part of what is being used to check H6.
_Social capital_ is also used in H6. It is an index created for this study, using @franzen2007sozialkapital. Social capital is captured in an index formed via membership indicator variables for church groups, sports clubs, charitable organizations, and art/music/recreational organizations. Cronbach's alpha for the index is at 0.71, indicating a fitting selection of items. It ranges from 1 (low social capital) to 5 (high social capital).
_Attitudes towards science_ is the variable used to test the novel hypothesis H7. It is also an index, ranging from 1 (negative view of science) to 10 (positive view of science). It was formed from two fitting items, containing the following (Cronbach's alpha = 0.75):

+ "Science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable"
+ "Because of science and technology, there will be more opportunities for the next generation"

## Method: individual country-wise binary logistic regressions
Now that the variables have been explained, a brief paragraph about the methods of this paper shall also clarify more of its thrust. It will contain per-country binary logistic regression results, being reported both as log-odds coefficients to determine the influence of the independent variables quickly (Figure 1) and odds ratio coefficients to quantify the strength of the influence (Figure 2).

## Uni- and bivariate analysis: taking a look at the variable 'expert' for technocratic attitudes
First of all, it would be a good idea to take a look at the dependent variable individually. For this purpose, a small frequency table, as well as a visualization of both the 4-level and the binary version of it have been constructed (see Appendix A).
From it, we can see that there are generally speaking slightly more people that have a positive view of technocracy within the sample. In the more fine-grained 4-level view, we can also see that most of them (~61%) answered in the mid-categories, not the more 'extreme' ones.

What is also interesting, is a look into each individual country (Appendix B). It becomes clear that in Greece and Germany, people are more critical towards technocracy than in the other countries. In Argentina, there are more favourable views, but in general, people are divided into two nearly equally big groups. In Brazil and Romania though, citizens with positive attitudes towards technocracy are the majority. This is interesting, especially when looking at both extremes: both Greece and Romania have experience with technocratic governments, both are located in Europe --- but the attitudes towards the concept are radically different. This can perhaps be explained by referencing to the financial crisis and the austerity reforms in Greece. Citizens might link this with technocrats being in charge, thus being more critical towards it.

## Multivariate analysis: regression models per country
```{r creation: reg. subsets, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
## data set 1: Germany
wvs7GER <- wvs7Chiru %>% dplyr::filter(country %in% c("DEU"))

## data set 2: Greece
wvs7GRC <- wvs7Chiru %>% dplyr::filter(country %in% c("GRC"))

## data set 3: Romania
wvs7ROU <- wvs7Chiru %>% dplyr::filter(country %in% c("ROU"))

## data set 4: Brazil
wvs7BRA <- wvs7Chiru %>% dplyr::filter(country %in% c("BRA"))

## data set 5: Argentina
wvs7ARG <- wvs7Chiru %>% dplyr::filter(country %in% c("ARG"))
```

After this uni- and bivariate approach, the next step is to take a look at the regression results for the countries. In a first step, the country subsets were created. Then, as explained, a binary logistic regression model was fit to the data per country. A graphical version can be found in the appendix (Appendix C), for the interpretation here, this paper will concentrate on the regression tables. For the interpretation process, this paper orientates itself by @wenzelburger2014statistische, especially the chapter on logistic regression analysis [see @wenzelburger2014statistische, pp. 55-89]. Coefficients and odds ratios are rounded to two digits. In the case of odds ratios under the threshold of 1, reciprocal values were reported, indicating the odds of an event *not* happening.

From there, we can see that the first variable concerning the _left-right self-placement_ of citizens is not significant. Therefore, no statistically sound and correct inferences can be drawn with regard to technocratic attitudes. This also means that, in the context of this paper, there is no evidence in favour of *H4* across countries. This is also the same for the _corruption perception_ of citizens, meaning that also *H5* cannot be accepted under these circumstances for any case.

_Political interest_ on the other hand, the effect on technocratic attitudes is significant with citizens both in Germany and in Argentina. Taking a look at the regression tables, we can infer from Figure 1 that the direction is as intended (with [1] symbolizing that the coefficient is for the politically interested citizens). A politically interested citizen is less likely to find technocracy an appealing concept than one that is not interested in politics. This finding is in line with *H3* for the respective countries. To quantify the results, the odds ratios are used: with the variable increasing by one unit, the odds of *not* having technocratic attitudes increase by the factors of 1.68 (Germany) and 1.88 (Argentina) --- ceteris paribus.

Moving on to _political trust_, one can find a significant effect for Romania, which is also in the intended direction: higher values of political trust correspond with a less technocratic attitude of citizens. Quantifying it again by using odds ratios, one can see that for a one-unit increase on the political trust scale, the odds of *not* having technocratic attitudes increases by the factor of 1.11. Evidence can therefore be found in favour of *H2* for the Romanian case.

For the effect of _satisfaction with democracy_, this paper receives (at first) counterintuitive results for Germany and Greece: the coefficient is significant, but the direction is not as intended, with higher values on the satisfaction scale corresponding with the occurence of technocratic attitudes. The effect is not large, quantifying it via the odds ratios again, with a one unit increase of satisfaction corresponding with an increased odds of having technocratic attitudes of a factor of 1.08 (Germany) and 1.10 (Greece), respectively. This paper therefore rejects *H1* in the countries, where the coefficient was significant.
The effect remains somewhat puzzling; an attempt to explain this finding can be made by taking a look at @lavezzolo2021will again. They explicitly describe so-called _technopols_ as the form technocracy takes most often in everyday politics. Technopols are full party politicians that nevertheless exert expertise to a certain degree, having a technical/knowledge-based background. The authors also point out that there is a strong demand for this type of politician, [see @lavezzolo2021will, p. 1507; for the concept of technopols explained in more detail, see @joignant2011technopols]. Form this point of view, one could argue that it is possible that people _can_ indeed be satisfied with democracy _and_ in favour of technocracy in some more adapted, within-democracy form.

_Age_ of respondents and _income_ are another two variables that do not possess statistical significance in the logistic regression model across all countries. For citizens' _educational level_, a significant coefficient can be found in the Romanian case. The effect points in the intended direction, indicating that with higher educational level, one can also find more technocratic attitudes in citizens of this country (factors: 2.02 for mid-level, 2.60 for high-level education). The reasoning behind this may be, what was already mentioned by @chiru2022wants: people with higher education tend to belong to a social elite that may see technocracy as a means to counteract radical forces, creating a save haven for their assets. Also, these people may even consider themselves to be experts or possess a great amount of knowledge, rendering technocracy a viable alternative for them to make their voices more heard in politics --- an argument in a more similar vein to @bickerton2020technocracy.
_Social capital_ is also significant in two cases (Germany and Greece), but here, the effect remains somewhat unclear. In Germany, the analysis finds evidence in favour of *H6*: people with higher social capital are more likely to be in favour of technocratic attitudes (factor: 1.14 for having technocratic attitudes for a one-point increase on the social capital scale). In Greece, the effect is inverted, though: people with higher social capital are less likely to find technocracy appealing (factor: 1.41 for *not* having technocratic attitudes for a one-point increase on the social capital scale).
With _income_ having an insignificant coefficient, the effect of _educational level_, despite its significance and effect, only being significant in one country, and the findings regarding _social capital_ being somewhat unclear, this paper rejects H6. The findings of @chiru2022wants could not exactly be recreated in this paper, indicating that further research has to be done in this direction.

The analysis is coming to a close with a last look at the _attitudes of citizens towards science and technology_ and the novel hypothesis *H7*. Here, one can find two significant coefficients for Germany and Brazil. The direction is not as was intended in the beginning, indicating that citizens with more positive attitudes towards science tend to view technocracy more negatively. The effect is rather small quantitatively, indicating factors of 1.08 (Germany) and 1.06 (Brazil) for *not* having technocratic attitudes for a one-point increase on the scale of scientific and technological attitudes.

# Discussion of results and final considerations

<!-- + discuss what we found out -->
<!-- + discuss what that means with regard to especially Bertsou/Pastorella's findings from 2017 with the old data -->
<!-- + discuss if there are any implications about what should be examined more closely in the future: ESPECIALLY WITH BETTER DATA AVAILABILITY! -->

It is clear that the novel hypothesis concerning attitudes towards science and technology and their effect on technocratic attitudes within citizens are tested in a rather small space here. The results can only be considered preliminary in nature, thus making it a desideratum to expand research, with more data becoming available in the future and more efforts being made in the research direction of technocratic attitudes.

Also, another question can be addressed: the operationalization of the variable. In this paper, as was already discussed, an index of two items was built. The value of Cronbach's alpha was also reported as satisfactory. But there are more other possibilities, e. g. to incorporate more of the science-focused questions from the WVS into an even more fleshed out index. Another possibility would be to design a study centered around these scientific attitudes and values of people, where one would have to first come up with a fitting questionnaire. In there, the questions or statements should revolve only around the views of respondents on science and technology, plus established context variables like political trust and interest.
As was already mentioned throughout this paper, the field of attitudinal research, concentrating on technocratic attitudes in particular, is still an evolving one with lots of 'moving parts'. Scholars have not come to as many decisive conclusions as is the case with e. g. populism. Therefore, data availability is a big desideratum, too.

For future scholarly research, another thinkable relationship concerning technocratic attitudes within citizens shall be proposed, which was not included in this study due to the space limitations. As sort of a counterpart to opinions on science and technology, also religiosity is an imaginable variable when researching technocratic attitudes. A few preliminary steps in this direction were done in the data preparation part of this paper.

What this paper has shown is that there is still a lot of research to be done in the future. A few effects that have been discussed by different scholars have proven to hold also in this particular setting, but not all of them provided uncontested results. The reason of this is clearly the ever-evolving nature of the topic --- which is on the other hand also opening up a lot of new opportunities and research spaces for political scientists to explore new focal points within the subject.
